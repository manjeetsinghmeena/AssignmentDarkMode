This repository contains a **starter Android project** built using **Kotlin and XML layouts** for a UI-focused assignment.

The goal of this challenge is to test your understanding of **Android UI fundamentals, layout structure, state handling, and theming**, not to build a large or complex app.

---

## Challenge Objective

You are given a **pre-built Android screen in Light Mode**.

Your task is to:

* Convert the UI from **Light Mode → Dark Mode**

  **OR**

* Enhance the screen by adding **additional UI elements or improvements** while keeping the design clean and readable

You are free to be creative, but keep the scope reasonable.

---

## Topics This Challenge Covers

You are expected to work with (or revise):

### Kotlin Basics

* `var` vs `val`
* Basic data types (`String`, `Int`, `Boolean`)
* `if / else` statements
* Functions
* Nullable types (`Int?`, `String?`)

### Android UI & Core Concepts

* XML layouts
* `LinearLayout` (vertical and horizontal)
* `TextView`, `EditText`, `ImageView`, `Button`
* Padding, margin, and background styling
* Handling button click events
* Manual UI updates from Kotlin
* `findViewById`
* Navigation using `Intent`
* Passing data between Activities
* Basic theming and color usage

---

## What You Are Allowed to Do

You may:

* Modify colors, fonts, spacing, and layout
* Improve Light Mode → Dark Mode compatibility
* Add new UI components (toggles, helper text, status indicators, etc.)
* Improve visual hierarchy and readability
* Refactor hardcoded colors into resources

You do **not** need:

* External libraries
* Networking or backend logic
* Advanced architecture (MVVM, DI, etc.)

---

## What You Should NOT Do


* Do not add heavy third-party dependencies
* Do not rewrite the entire app from scratch

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork the Repository

Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.

---

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/UIChallenge.git
cd Android
```

---

### 3. Open the Project

Open the project in **Android Studio** and run the app on:

* Emulator
* Physical Android device

(Both are acceptable)

---

### 4. Work on the Challenge

Modify the existing **XML layouts and Kotlin Activities** to:

* Implement Dark Mode properly

  **OR**

* Enhance the UI while maintaining usability and consistency

Focus on **clarity and correctness**, not over-engineering.

## Assignment Submission (Important)

Submit your assignment using the following Google Form link:

**Submission Folder**
[here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf5behp6IUB8Eq1BA8XPMTBOckJuZm7mFgKJZSV_sY8THLznA/viewform)

### What to Upload

- A text file containing the link to your forked GitHub repository

Make sure your **name is clearly mentioned**.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

Submissions will be evaluated based on:

* Correct use of XML layouts
* Proper handling of UI state in Kotlin
* Dark Mode readability and contrast
* Clean and understandable code
* UI clarity and consistency
* Reasonable creativity (not unnecessary complexity)

---

## Bonus (Optional)

* Proper use of color resources for theming
* Cleaner spacing and alignment
* Small UX improvements (helper text, feedback messages)
* Accessibility-friendly text sizes and contrast

---

## Final Note

This challenge is designed to test **fundamentals**, not perfection.

Focus on understanding how Android UI works, how state affects views, and how to structure clean layouts.

Breaking the UI is part of learning.

**Good Luck!!!**
